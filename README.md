# Sample Flask App

This is me learning how to write a simple flask application. It will eventually have the following features:

- postgres database backend
- strongly hashed (scrypt) passwords
- basic login page/signup page
- page to get all uploaded documents w/links to get and delete documents
- page to upload a new document

To set this up:

- install python3 w/pip and virtualenv
- create a virtualenv with `python3 -m virtualenv env`
- cd into `env`, `source bin/activate`, `git clone https://github.com/jonbodner/learn-flask.git`
- instructions to get out the pip information coming soon...
